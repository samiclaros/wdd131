            <p class="myself-introduction-about-us-page">My name is Samuel, I am 22 years old and I am from the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia. I currently serve as second counselor in my ward, 
            previously having stake callings. I have an older brother, 33 years old. I love video games, movies, sports and I love listening to music. Currently my favorite artist is Bad Bunny
            and the song I listen to the most lately is by Nicki Nicole "Ojos Verdes"</p>

            <p class="baptism-of-fidelina">I served a mission in Ecuador Quito Norte, I returned home 1 year and 5 months ago. The mission was a unique and totally satisfactory experience. My 
            testimony grew and I loved each of the people I met. In fact, I remember saying that I am part of Ecuador, I lived with them, talked with them and I also dressed like them. I was 
            TR, TR and DL, ZL and had other assignments within the mission. I had two mission presidents, but the one I owe a lot to is President Roman and his wife. Currently he is a seventy area general, 
            which is why I feel so proud to have learned from him.</p>

            <p class="purpose-of-the-site">This site is created to meet a need that I had one day, but I didn't know or I didn't have anyone to ask. In this case, I want to help them not be lost, in addition 
            to guaranteeing their families that with these clothes they will be fine for two years. In addition to giving these clothes in an accessible way to everyone and also having personalized payment plans 
            (installments) for a time. I created this page because I want to help you help comfortably without having to worry about whether or not you will have the necessary clothing, also for your families.</p>
